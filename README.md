# BasicPixyTextp5js
A basic pixelated text rendering library for p5 powered by [Pixyp5js](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Pixyp5js).

Create a font and load it using `LoadFont` and use `RenderText` to render text. To design your font (or to be lazy) you can use
default-font.js which contains a font variable named `font`. (Very creative name ik)

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/Pixyp5js/pixy.js and https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/BasicPixyTextp5js/basicpixytext.js in your HTML file!
If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.
