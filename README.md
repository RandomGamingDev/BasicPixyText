# BasicPixyTextp5js
A basic pixelated text rendering library for p5 powered by [Pixyp5js](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Pixyp5js).

Create a font and load it using `LoadFont` and use `RenderText` or `RenderTextLinkedList` (if you're using the latter check below for more info) to render text. To design your font (or to be lazy) you can use
default-font.js which contains a font variable named `font`. (Very creative name ik)

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/Pixyp5js/pixy.js (This is the Pixy library that BasicPixyTextp5js relies on) and https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/BasicPixyTextp5js/basicpixytext.js in your HTML file!
If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

To include the default font simply do the same thing with https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/BasicPixyTextp5js/default-font.js.

https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/OneWayLinkedListLibJs or https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/DoubleLinkedListLibJs/tree/main are dependencies if you want to use `RenderTextLinkedList`. To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/OneWayLinkedListLibJs/list.js or https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/DoubleLinkedListLibJs/list.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
